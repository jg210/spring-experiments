* Publish.
  - without https->http proxy server, can only host via http since app connects to http-only FSA API.
    => couldn't use github pages.
  - setting up EC2 instance with https certificate
    - AWS certificates are free, but only work with load balancers etc., which aren't free
    - let's encrypt + certbot on EC2
      - but would need own DNS record
      - certificates are listed publicly
        - github site will be public too though
  - create proxy for S3 buckets and FHS
    - rate limiting?
  - host static content with github pages and run proxy on EC2?
    - proxy would have to use wildcard CORS header
  - add link to README.md
  - http redirection
    - https://letsencrypt.org/docs/allow-port-80/

* Find way to automate npm audit
  - currently have unfixed errors in dependencies of latest react-scripts
  - only fail if errors are above low priority?
    - there's no option for that
  - there are wrapper projects for npm audit.
  - can travis CI do warnings?
  
* Use https://fb.me/react-error-boundaries to mask back traces.

* Failed-connection handling.

* Verify json metadata in case get paged data.
  - check meta.totalPages is 1.
  - check meta.returncode is OK.

* Download data using paged APIs, to prevent truncation.

* Local Authority could be removed while app running.

* Improve visual design.

* Localization.

* jest snapshot tests?

* Automated browser tests.

* Test for too many local authorities.

* A way to refresh list of local authorities without refreshing whole page?

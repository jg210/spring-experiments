* Try out redux-toolkit query.
  - unit test cache expiry
    - might need to reduce below polling interval to make this possible?
  - unit test polling
  - unit test changing Table localAuthorityId
    - would have found data/currentData bug
    - should go back to loading... state
  - add current epoch to API and show in UI.
    - since now have caching
  - disable redux dev tools in production
    - enabled by Redux Tool Kit

* Assert correct id selected in list in App.test.tsx.
  - https://cathalmacdonnacha.com/how-to-test-a-select-element-with-react-testing-library

* Use redux for App's localAuthorityId
  - https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-with-typescript

* Get rid of narrow white gap around bar graph bars.

* vitest failures don't appear in VSC.

* Export OpenAPI spec. from spring boot server and use it in front end
  - generate RTK Query API
  - can MSW mocks be typed automatically too?

* More cypress tests.

* Analytics.

* Sentry.

* Add pip constraints file.

* Retries with exponential backoff for failed requests (e.g. from 429 from lambda rate limiting).
  - https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/customizing-queries#automatic-retries
  - https://mswjs.io/docs/api/http#once should allow this to be tested?

* 0% rows generally have non-zero bar graph size
  - from rounding
  - show count in html title tooltip or extra column?

* Cache npm files on github actions.

* Enable branch protection rule for master.

* Split gradle checks into multiple github actions steps?

* Should be able to use shadowJar in place of bootJar
  - shadowJar is lacking most manifest attributes so isn't executable.

* A release branch, so can fix problems without breaking aws-experiments deployment?
  - or single branch and versioned publishing

* Client-side crash reporting.

* Server-side crash reporting.

* Add package javadoc explaining purpose of Fsa* and api classes.

* More method/class javadoc.

* Test FsaService json parsing using file:/// URLs.

* Unit tests for lambda (in addition to cypress end-to-end tests).
  - https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/main/aws-lambda-java-tests
    - doesn't have API gateway support?
  - https://github.com/brefphp/local-api-gateway

* Add VSC launch configs for npm install and npm start.
  - add npm start config to spring-experiments.code-workspace compound launch config.

* Nullable/NonNull annotations.

* Role better than access key for publishing?
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#Using_CreateAccessKey

* Polling of APIs could mean that a localAuthorityId disappears.
  - with much much greater probability than is currently possible.
  - but still not very likely

* Add favicon.ico.

* gradle bootRun task depends on react/npm tasks even though doesn't use their output.

* Some TODO comments live in aws-experiments repo.

* Add /fsa context path to paths.
  - redirect using nginx if use empty path.

* Rename project.
  - its not just spring any more.

* Configure https.
  - nginx
  - firewall
  - GA "property" is configured with "http".
  - link(s) in github repo.
  - https certificate
    - AWS certificates are free, but only work with load balancers etc., which aren't free
    - let's encrypt + certbot on EC2
      - but would need own DNS record
      - certificates are listed publicly
        - github site will be public too though
  - http redirection
    - https://letsencrypt.org/docs/allow-port-80/

* Use https://fb.me/react-error-boundaries to mask back traces.

* Improved failed-connection handling.

* Verify json metadata in case get paged data.
  - check meta.totalPages is 1.
  - check meta.returncode is OK.
  - check meta.totalCount is correct.

* Always download data using paged APIs.

* Find way to automate npm audit
  - currently have unfixed errors in dependencies of latest react-scripts
  - only fail if errors are above low priority?
    - there's no option for that
  - there are wrapper projects for npm audit.
  - can travis CI do warnings?

* Local Authority could be removed while app running.
  - but a query for an unknown authority returns empty list.

* Improve visual design.

* Localization.

* snapshot tests.

* Actuator logging?
  - https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html
  - authentication or endpoints.trace.sensitive=false in debug only (or block with nginx)

* RestTemplate will be deprecated and asks that you use reactive WebClient instead.

* Make FsaService into interface, so can mock it without having to make methods/class non-final.

* Lint for github actions config.

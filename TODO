* Why are there no sentry.io requests from production in browser network connection debugger?
  - vite preview doesn't have this problem
  - browser requesting https://aws.jeremygreen.me.uk/assets/index-cQ6a5IW-.js
  - e317 is reported in the App tooltip as version
  - that's built by https://github.com/jg210/spring-experiments/actions/runs/7976066640
  - has AWS jar artifact with public/assets/index-UNBOAu1w.js that has sentry DSN in it
  - why are filenames different?
    - ...since publish is rebuilding the dist/ directory.   

* https://jeremy-green.sentry.io/settings/projects/spring-experiments/source-maps/release-bundles/spring-experiments%40e317e71/
  - current lambda release
  - no source maps uploaded according to sentry.io
  - but they were uploaded according to this
    - https://github.com/jg210/spring-experiments/actions/runs/7976066640/job/21775743397
      -  [sentry-vite-plugin] Info: Successfully uploaded source maps to Sentry

* Sentry-github integration

* https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/features/redux/

* https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/features/component-tracking/ breaks app...

* Sentry js self profiling
  - https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/profiling/
  - set HTTP header
  - enable in config.

* Assert correct id selected in list in App.test.tsx.
  - https://cathalmacdonnacha.com/how-to-test-a-select-element-with-react-testing-library

* Use redux for App's localAuthorityId
  - https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-with-typescript

* Crash test button for testing sentry.
  - triple click on retrieved text?
  - add hamburger menu?

* Export OpenAPI spec. from spring boot server and use it in front end
  - generate RTK Query API
  - can MSW mocks be typed automatically too?

* More cypress tests.

* Analytics.

* Client-side crash reporting.

* Bug report for use-debounce isPending().
  - https://github.com/xnimorz/use-debounce
  - https://github.com/jg210/spring-experiments/pull/41/commits/ab055f1dbdfa7a9b00c04c1d01cb7b153121bf7f was my workaround.

* Reduce RTK Query retry interval in unit tests?

* Check for carets in package.json in unit tests.

* Add pip constraints file.

* 0% rows generally have non-zero bar graph size
  - from rounding
  - show count in html title tooltip or extra column?

* Cache npm files on github actions.

* Enable branch protection rule for master.

* Automated licence management.

* Split gradle checks into multiple github actions steps?

* Split github action job into multiple jobs.

* Should be able to use shadowJar in place of bootJar.

* A release branch, so can fix problems without breaking aws-experiments deployment?
  - or single branch and versioned publishing

* Sentry for spring-boot server
  - dev/sentry_for_server
  - memory use likely a problem
    - https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/3182
  - set DSN
    - https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/configuration/
    - EC2
      - dev/sentry_for_server
        - untested
    - lambda
  - does something need to call Sentry.init()?
  - set environment
  - make sure release id is same as for front end
  - source code?
  - are events reliably sent from lambdas?
  - make sure ec2 and lambda can be distinguised.

* Add package javadoc explaining purpose of Fsa* and api classes.

* More method/class javadoc.

* RenderWithStore component would be better as a function.
  - less verbose
  - could return extra objects, e.g. the store.

* Test FsaService json parsing using file:/// URLs.

* Unit tests for lambda (in addition to cypress end-to-end tests).
  - https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/main/aws-lambda-java-tests
    - doesn't have API gateway support?
  - https://github.com/brefphp/local-api-gateway

* Add VSC launch configs for npm install and npm start.
  - add npm start config to spring-experiments.code-workspace compound launch config.

* Nullable/NonNull annotations.

* Role better than access key for publishing?
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#Using_CreateAccessKey

* Automated testing of sentry configuration
  - front end
  - server

* Polling of APIs could mean that a localAuthorityId disappears.
  - with much much greater probability than is currently possible.
  - but still not very likely

* Add favicon.ico.

* gradle bootRun task depends on react/npm tasks even though doesn't use their output.

* Some TODO comments live in aws-experiments repo.

* Add /fsa context path to paths.
  - redirect using nginx if use empty path.

* Rename project.
  - it's not just spring any more.

* Configure https.
  - nginx
  - firewall
  - GA "property" is configured with "http".
  - link(s) in github repo.
  - https certificate
    - AWS certificates are free, but only work with load balancers etc., which aren't free
    - let's encrypt + certbot on EC2
      - but would need own DNS record
      - certificates are listed publicly
        - github site will be public too though
  - http redirection
    - https://letsencrypt.org/docs/allow-port-80/

* Use https://fb.me/react-error-boundaries to mask back traces.

* unit test cache expiry and polling
  - might need to reduce below polling interval to make this possible?
  - https://mswjs.io/docs/recipes/polling/
  - not clear if MSW etc. work with useFakeTimers() - 8e7785d889323f7cdd464bfac074466d3d487ff3

* unit test changing Table localAuthorityId shows loading... state again 

* Error message if run out of retries.
  - or infinite retries and a network connectivity warning?

* Verify json metadata in case get paged data.
  - check meta.totalPages is 1.
  - check meta.returncode is OK.
  - check meta.totalCount is correct.

* Always download data using paged APIs.

* Dependabot?  

* Local Authority could be removed while app running.
  - but a query for an unknown authority returns empty list.

* Improve visual design.

* Detect circular imports in CI.

* Localization.

* snapshot tests.

* Actuator logging?
  - https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html
  - authentication or endpoints.trace.sensitive=false in debug only (or block with nginx)

* RestTemplate will be deprecated and asks that you use reactive WebClient instead.

* Make FsaService into interface, so can mock it without having to make methods/class non-final.

* Lint for github actions config.

* Is there a GitHub Actions vitest clover action?

* Better looking sentry ErrorFallback component.

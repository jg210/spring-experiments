* Embed react app in the project.
  X commit unmodified source code
  - set up build and development environment
  - invoke package.json ci script from maven/travis.
  - replace hello-world MVC web UI with the react app
  - set up pass-through proxy for API server
  - update README's CORS section
  - replace react source code in old repo with README pointing at new home.
  - some TODO comments live in aws-experiments repo.

* Rename project.
  - its not just spring any more.

* Convert pass-through proxy into GraphQL server.

* Set up EC2 instance with https certificate
    - AWS certificates are free, but only work with load balancers etc., which aren't free
    - let's encrypt + certbot on EC2
      - but would need own DNS record
      - certificates are listed publicly
        - github site will be public too though

* http redirection
  - https://letsencrypt.org/docs/allow-port-80/

* Proxy rate limiting.

* Find way to automate npm audit
  - currently have unfixed errors in dependencies of latest react-scripts
  - only fail if errors are above low priority?
    - there's no option for that
  - there are wrapper projects for npm audit.
  - can travis CI do warnings?
  
* Use https://fb.me/react-error-boundaries to mask back traces.

* Failed-connection handling.

* Verify json metadata in case get paged data.
  - check meta.totalPages is 1.
  - check meta.returncode is OK.

* Download data using paged APIs, to prevent truncation.

* Local Authority could be removed while app running.

* Improve visual design.

* Localization.

* jest snapshot tests?

* Automated browser tests.

* Test for too many local authorities.

* A way to refresh list of local authorities without refreshing whole page?

* VSC auto completion doesn't work for java.

* Implement proxy server to avoid same-origin issues and allow use of https.
  - implement and use score-summation API
  - update README
    - "The server also provides a proxy for the underlying API (avoiding same-origin/CORS-related issues)."
    - CORS section
  - convert unit tests from js to java

      it('extracts local authorities from json', () => {
          const localAuthorities = extractLocalAuthorities(AUTHORITIES_JSON);
          expect(localAuthorities.length).toEqual(392);
          expect(localAuthorities[7]).toEqual({
              "localAuthorityId": 132,
              "name": "Antrim and Newtownabbey"
          });
      });

      it('extracts unique local authority ids from json', () => {
          const localAuthorities = extractLocalAuthorities(AUTHORITIES_JSON);
          const localAuthorityIds = new Set(
              localAuthorities.map(localAuthority => localAuthority.localAuthorityId)
          );
          expect(localAuthorityIds.size).toEqual(localAuthorities.length);
      });

* Add VSC launch configs for npm install and npm start.

* Merge some/all of the two README files.

* Versioning of build.gradle dependencies.

* package-lock.json is not stable.

* Some TODO comments live in aws-experiments repo.

* Add /fsa context path to paths.
  - redirect using nginx if use empty path.

* Rename project.
  - its not just spring any more.

* Set up EC2 instance with https certificate
    - AWS certificates are free, but only work with load balancers etc., which aren't free
    - let's encrypt + certbot on EC2
      - but would need own DNS record
      - certificates are listed publicly
        - github site will be public too though

* http redirection
  - https://letsencrypt.org/docs/allow-port-80/

* Proxy rate limiting.

* Find way to automate npm audit
  - currently have unfixed errors in dependencies of latest react-scripts
  - only fail if errors are above low priority?
    - there's no option for that
  - there are wrapper projects for npm audit.
  - can travis CI do warnings?
  
* Use https://fb.me/react-error-boundaries to mask back traces.

* Java static analysis.

* Java unit tests.

* Failed-connection handling.

* Verify json metadata in case get paged data.
  - check meta.totalPages is 1.
  - check meta.returncode is OK.

* Download data using paged APIs, to prevent truncation.

* Local Authority could be removed while app running.
  - the 404 is ignored and loading... is shown forever.

* Improve visual design.

* Localization.

* jest snapshot tests?

* Automated browser tests.

* Test for too many local authorities.

* A way to refresh list of local authorities without refreshing whole page?

* Actuator logging?
  - https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html
  - authentication or endpoints.trace.sensitive=false in debug only (or block with nginx)

* RestTemplate will be deprecated and asks that you use reactive WebClient instead.
